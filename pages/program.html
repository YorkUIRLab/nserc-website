  </div>
  <div class="modal-body">
    <p>	The number and impact of natural, technological and human-made disasters and
		emergencies are rising in Canada and globally. As a result, demands for HQPs in disaster and emergency
		management profession and relevant industries have sharply increased in recent years and will continue
		to grow in the future. According to market analysts (Marketsandmarkets.com), the global market for
		public safety and emergency management products and services is expected to grow from $415.53
		billion in 2013 to $544.02 billion by 2018. However, Canada's share in this industry, especially in the
		information technology related section, is very minimal. This is in part due to the lack of organized 
		and coordinated training and research in this area. </br>
		Our ADERSIM trainees will enhance Canada's human
		resources and scientific and engineering capacities in this rapidly growing industry. They will be able 
		to develop advanced, intelligent, agent-based real-time computer simulations, which play an important 
		role in disaster and emergency mitigation, preparedness, response, and recovery planning and management.

  </div>
  <div class="modal-body">
    <p>		The long term goal of ADERSIM is to enhance Canada's scientific
	and technological capacities in public safety and emergency management through innovative training,
	research, and development of professionals in state-of-the-art simulation and emergency management
	systems. In the short-term, the ADERSIM program will: 1) train a large number of the next generation
	HQPs with interdisciplinary, theoretical, technical, and professional skills in advanced disaster and
	emergency modeling, simulations and information management to meet Canada's and global demands in
	emergency management and public safety industry; 2) develop and test a set of new, high-tech, low-cost,
	scalable, and user friendly disaster and emergency simulation tools and technologies in close partnership
	with a large number of Canadian industry partners and a wide range of end user organizations; 3) provide
	trainees with rich and unique educational experiences, professional activities, career development,
	knowledge transformation and mobilization, and leadership skills in industry, government and academia
	through customized curriculums, internships with industry and end users, student exchanges, summer
	schools, and student exchange programs with national and international partners.

  </div>
  <div class="modal-body">
    <p>		Developing successful disaster and emergency simulation tools requires backgrounds in four key areas:
	subject disaster risk (flood, earthquake, hurricane, industrial accidents, etc.), disaster and emergency
	management functions (search and rescue, disaster logistics, evacuation, etc.), disaster and emergency
	information management (spatial and non-spatial), and mathematical modeling and computer simulation.
	Students recruited to the ADERSIM program should have strong background in at least two areas.
	Participants of the ADERSIM program will be trained to conduct coordinated, synchronized and
	complimentary research and development in disaster simulations using our network of interconnected labs including the cutting edge Disaster and Emergency Simulation Facility at York University.

    <h3 >Future Career Possibilities for Trainees</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="modal-body">
    <p>	The ADERSIM program facilitates the transition of
	trainees into the workforce that includes academia, industry, government, and non-governmental
	organizations. PDF and PhD trainees will be able to find jobs in a growing academic environment related
	to public safety and emergency management. While more disaster and emergency management programs
	are needed, trained professionals to teach and research are very limited. Trainees with a master's degree
	will join industry, government, or non-governmental organizations. Those with knowledge and skills in
	developing disaster information systems and simulation solutions will either join existing companies or
	will create their own companies. Some trainees are expected to join their internship companies and
	organizations and other large corporations that use technology and disaster and emergency simulations
	tools (i.e. airports, hydro companies, transportation companies, oil and gas companies, major banks and
	insurance). Moreover, large governmental and non-governmental organizations at federal and provincial
	levels also need experts in disaster and emergency management with IT and simulation expertise.
</br>
	 We anticipate that an interdisciplinary knowledge of disaster and emergency management, computer science,
	and information technology, management science, and mathematical modeling will provide our trainees
	with the knowledge and technical skills required to effectively work in one of the above organizations.
	However, having exposed and gained specific knowledge of the type of organizations and the type of
	disasters and emergencies that they are faced will be essential for our trainees. We believe that our
	trainees will get those skills and knowledge through internships and interactions that they have with
	partner organizations. As soon as our trainees join the program we will ask them to become a student
	member of professional associations (such as the International Association of Emergency Management
	and the Society for Modeling & Simulation International) in order to engage them with the professionals
	and experts in these fields. We also encourage our trainees to take part in relevant courses offered by
	government agencies and GIS software companies (such as courses offered by the government of Ontario
	on Incident Management System, ESRI on Advance GIS, and AnyLogic on agent based simulations).
