		</header>

		Our 2016 workshop was a success! 
		<p align="justify"> More than 25 participants from six universities across Canada attended the inaugural workshop 
		on June 10 to learn about and present on several ongoing projects within the program. Presentations 
		included real-time awareness in support of rapid disaster response, public health readiness during 
		infectious disease outbreaks and neutralizing improvised explosive devices. The program includes 11 
		researchers from York University, University of Calgary, McMaster University, University of Montreal, 
		Ryerson University and the University of Western Ontario, plus 27 other academic collaborators and 18 
		industrial partners. CREATE ADERSIM, under the leadership of Prof. Jimmy Huang at York University, has received <a href="http://yfile.news.yorku.ca/2015/05/20/nserc-awards-more-than-3-3-million-to-york-led-research-partnerships/" target="_blank">$1.65 million over six years</a> to improve Canadaâ€™s abilities in public safety and emergency management.</p>

		<p align="justify">"The ADERSIM CREATE program, funded by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, 
		will train 78 postdoctoral fellows and graduate students of the next generation of highly qualified 
		Canadians with excellent interdisciplinary, theoretical and professional skills in information searching, 
		data mining, knowledge management, modeling and simulations to meet Canada's current and future demands 
		in emergency management and the public safety industry," said Professor Celia Haig-Brown, associate vice-president Research. 
		"York has great strengths in interdisciplinary and collaborative research programs and it is wonderful to 
		see them in action through various research projects, including ADERSIM."
